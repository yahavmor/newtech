/* ============================================================================
   Shared countdown clock, used by the landing pages.

   How it works:
   - Every time this page loads (first visit, refresh, or coming back later),
     the clock always starts fresh at exactly 1 minute and counts down to 0.
     There is no persistence across page loads -- so it's simple and always
     predictable: land on the page, the clock says 01:00 / 00:00 and starts
     ticking down.
   - If it reaches 0, it simply restarts at 1 minute automatically, so it
     never gets stuck.
   - Every element with class "cd-mins" / "cd-secs" on the page is kept in
     sync, once per second. Any ancestor/element with class "countdown-clock"
     gets a "cc-critical" class added in the final 30 seconds, so the visual
     clock (see the .countdown-clock CSS on each page) can intensify -- faster
     pulse, redder glow -- to build urgency as time runs out.
   - Call initCountdown() after the DOM is ready. As a safety net, this file
     also starts the clock on its own (see the bottom of this file) so the
     countdown is guaranteed to start even if a page's own "call initCountdown
     on DOMContentLoaded" wiring never fires (e.g. because that listener was
     attached too late and the event had already passed).

  };

  // Safety net: this script loads in <head>, well before the page body is
  // parsed, so document.readyState here is reliably "loading" -- meaning we
  // can register a DOMContentLoaded listener now and be certain it will
  // fire. If for any reason this code runs after the DOM is already ready,
  // start immediately instead of waiting for an event that already passed.
